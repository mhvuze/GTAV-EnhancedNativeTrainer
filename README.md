**Changes in this personal branch**

- no animation cancel for airbreak

- two new speed options (very slow & crawling) for more refined placement

- toggles no collision once you enable airbreak

**Known bugs present in this personal branch**

- collision doesn't turn back on after disabling airbreak (temp fix: use hotkey_throughdoor after disabling airbreak to turn it back on, make sure you're above ground)
